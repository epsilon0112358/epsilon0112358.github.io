*What's up with the name?*
"epsilon" is a reference to one of my favorite math jokes.
>> Let Îµ < 0 (i.e. "Let epsilon be less than zero")

It's not very deep, but in short; The premise on countless mathematical statements and proofs is that epsilon is always **greater** than 0. So this looks absurd.

Plus some Fibonacci, because I'm geeky like that :-)
