# MVPs - most valuable platforms

## learning platforms
### [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/)
If you are new to the field of InfoSec, I would strongly suggest to visit their [Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/) first. The signup is free, and they have, at the time of writing, over 30 **free** Tier 0 modules going over a wide variety of cybersecurity as well as general networking and InfoSec concepts.
The material is in depth and of a fantastic quality, plus plenty of engaging exercises to solidify the concepts.

No local setup is needed, they include a browser based access through their PwnBox, which runs ParrotOS (a great security focused Linux distro)

They also have an [app](https://app.hackthebox.com/login?redirect=%2Fhome) platform to practice actual red team and blue team activities on vulnerable machines, as well as a [ctf](https://ctf.hackthebox.com/) section with frequent CTF events.

Be mindful that the app part and the Academy part are separate subscriptions, if you choose to invest into their platform.
### [Over The Wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)
A gamified approach to learn basic Linux and security concepts, which they call Wargames. They have content for absolute beginners and progress into higher difficulties. You ssh into each shell game level looking for information how to access the next level.
It teaches you how to research unfamiliar tools, and absolutely expects you to get stuck here and there, so you have to do some reading on how certain mechanics work - an indispensable skill to have in Cybersecurity!
### [Pwn College](https://pwn.college/)
Another gamified platform to learn the basics of Linux and InfoSec.
Their content, developed around Arizona State University's Cybersecurity curriculum, is very approachable with no prior knowledge, but at the same time goes very in depth with important skills and commands. 

And after signup, the entire content is free!

### [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security)
PortSwigger is the company behind the de facto standard of the web application security testing tool Burp Suite. Their academy both explains the theory around various attack types, and demonstrates their execution with Burp. Arguably an indispensable skill to have as a penetration tester or bug bounty hunter with any exposure to web applications.

## Tools
### [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
When it comes to note taking, this is arguably one of the most popular tools out there right now. It basically converts a directory on your computer into a vault, and using any scheme or convention you like you can organize (markdown formatted) notes for everyday tasks, studying, or penetration testing.

It's main selling point is how easy it is to link notes together that are related one way or another. This helps make connections while keeping each note manageble and on topic.

It has a bit of a learning curve to really appreciate its beauty, but it is worth the investment to get to know it!
### [Cherry Tree](https://www.giuspen.net/cherrytree/)
Yet another note taking app, geared towards simplicity and mobility. I like to use it "on the go", running it straight from a flash drive where I cannot or don't want to install software, and it lets you organize notes in a hierarchical tree structure.
### [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/)
This has become an indispensable tool for taking screenshots for me! It also comes with a "live" version for a flash drive, and it provides so much more functionality for screenshots than the common native apps.
Great for annotations, highlighting, editing, picture in picture applications, delayed screenshots and much, much more!
