# my first blog post

This is actually my third go on this blog, but for the sake of clarity, let's call this my first post!

What you are seeing here is hosted on GitHub through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Straight from the repository to your website! 
Back in high school I built a little home page tag by tag in HTML, but this seemed like a painstaking endeavor to recreate at this time. Writing it purely in markdown and viewing the rendered version on GitHub made the process of tweaking the page time consuming, and I quickly got tired of the constant committing and pushing.

I tried to give [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) a whirl, which is after all the recommended framework for a GitHub blog, but having no prior experience with Ruby, I got tangled up a bit.

A good friend of mine recommended [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), another static site generator using markdown, and as I am much more familiar with Python, I was immediately intrigued! 

> MkDocs is [...] **fast**, **simple** and **downright** gorgeous

The setup was simple, even on a Windows CLI, and happy with the basic themes and plugins it was the easiest framework to get started with.

So that's where we're at, at the time of writing. I don't want to spend too much time with front end and web development right now (though I might add some more detailed notes on my blog setup later), and rather delve deeper into cybersecurity.

Stay tuned!
