# InfoSec Cheat Sheets from SANS

I stumbled over a great resource today that seems too good not to share. I do enjoy condensed cheat sheets with common commands, flags, and other useful information on certain topics.
The SANS Institute (InfoSec and Cybersecurity training and certificates) has a whole bunch of them free to download!

For example [this one](https://sansorg.egnyte.com/dl/Rop1b0ElWo) on netcat, or [this one](https://sansorg.egnyte.com/dl/f4TCYNMgN6) for Google Hacking.

Will certainly keep some of those handy!

Check them all out [here](https://www.sans.org/posters/)


Other than that, I am currently working my way through [Pwn.College](https://pwn.college/) and PortSwigger's [Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security). Both are highly recommended educational platforms to get some hands-on experience with the Linux command line and Burp Suite respectively.
